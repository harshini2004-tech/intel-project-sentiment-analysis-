Sentiment Analysis

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze user and technical reviews of Intel products to enhance product quality and customer satisfaction. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, we classify and understand the sentiments expressed in the reviews accurately. Additionally, we examine seasonal variations in sentiment trends with respect to the year to provide targeted recommendations.

Data Sources:
The dataset includes user and technical reviews sourced from various platforms where feedback on Intel products is shared extracted using web scraping(APIs).

Key Technologies:
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): Used for sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation): Utilized for word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between words.
Steps for Analysis
Data Collection: Gather user and technical reviews from multiple sources.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise and irrelevant information.
Sentiment Analysis: Apply VADER to analyze the sentiment of each review.
Word Embeddings: Use GloVe to generate word embeddings for the reviews.
Classification: Classify the sentiments and analyze seasonal variations with respect to the year.
Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
Results
The project identifies sentiment trends in the reviews and offers recommendations for improving Intel products based on user and expert feedback. Seasonal variations in sentiment trends are also examined to understand how sentiments change over the year.
